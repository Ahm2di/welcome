## mrc-ide resources setup

Welcome to the centre/department.  In addition to all the official computational resources that you will have a form about on starting, there are more available to you.

* A departmentmental [slack](https://slack.com) workspace, available at [dideimperial.slack.com](https://dideimperial.slack.com) (though we highly recommend using a [desktop app](https://slack.com/downloads)).
* Access to the departmental github organisation [`mrc-ide`](https://github.com/mrc-ide) which gives free private repos with more flexible collaboration options than personal repositories use.

### Steps

1. If you do not have one, please create a github account by visiting https://github.com
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/emails and add your imperial email address to your github account.  You can have multiple email addresses associated with your account, which comes in useful
1. Fill in [this very short form](https://rich284.typeform.com/to/COq4zn) with your name, email and github account name
1. Watch out for two emails in your imperial inbox - one with an invitation to the slack and the other for github

The form will email people who can set you up - it shouldn't take more than a day or so.

### Github is sending too many emails

Go to https://github.com/settings/notifications and:

* Untick **Automatically watch repositories**
* Untick **Email** under **Watching**
* Set up an email filter to collect all emails from `notifications@github.com` to be routed to a folder separate from your inbox (but still keep an eye on it)

### Slack sends me messages all the time

Slack will eventually tell you how to tone it down, but in slack's preferences, in the **Notifications** tab, select the second option under **Notify me about** (it will say **Direct messages, mentions & keywords**)

### Connecting to DIDE From the outside

For the best network speed and reliability, use a wired network connection. When this is not possible, you'll need to 
use Pulse Secure to access network shares, or to access your desktop PC by remote access. See [here](VPN.md)

### I hear we have a cluster :computer::computer::computer:

Please see the documentation to get started:

* Non R users: https://mrcdata.dide.ic.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Cluster_Documentation
* R users: [read this](https://mrc-ide.github.io/didehpc/vignettes/didehpc.html) and [this](https://mrc-ide.github.io/didehpc/vignettes/quickstart.html)

You will need your account activated - if you email or slack Wes he can do this for you.
