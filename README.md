## mrc-ide resources setup

Welcome to the centre/department.  In addition to all the official computational resources that you will have a form about on starting, there are more available to you.

* A departmentmental [slack](https://slack.com) workspace, available at [dideimperial.slack.com](https://dideimperial.slack.com) (though we highly recommend using a [desktop app](https://slack.com/downloads)).
* Access to the departmental github organisation [`mrc-ide`](https://github.com/mrc-ide) which gives free private repos with more flexible collaboration options than personal repositories use.

### Steps

1. If you do not have one, please create a github account by visiting https://github.com
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/emails and add your imperial email address to your github account.  You can have multiple email addresses associated with your account, which comes in useful
1. Fill in [this very short form](https://rich284.typeform.com/to/COq4zn) with your name, email and github account name
1. (optional) Send an email to Rich or Wes to let them know you've done this
1. Watch out for two emails in your imperial inbox - one with an invitation to the slack and the other for github

### Github is sending too many emails

Go to https://github.com/settings/notifications and:

* Untick **Automatically watch repositories**
* Untick **Email** under **Watching**
* Set up an email filter to collect all emails from `notifications@github.com` to be routed to a folder separate from your inbox (but still keep an eye on it)

### Slack sends me messages all the time

Slack will eventually tell you how to tone it down, but in slack's preferences, in the **Notifications** tab, select the second option under **Notify me about** (it will say **Direct messages, mentions & keywords**
